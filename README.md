# Story
The sunday morning at 7 AM feels quiet. A little... too quiet. You feel that something is off until you realize it.
The grass! It's getting too long again! Being the crappy neigbor that you are, you start up the lawn mower, waking
up dozens of angered people in the process.
	But then you notice an unnatural object through the weeds. It seems the neighborhood has had enough of your
mowing activities, since they have installed mines all over your lawn! Get ready to test your mine defusing skills
in the game where Minesweeper meets gardening chores!

# Controls
The game is controlled in first person mode. Look around by moving the mouse. Control your movements with the w, a,
s and d keys.

The player can work with two Minesweeper tools: the lawn mower and the flag. Only one tool can be wielded at any
time. The player starts off with the lawn mower equipped. With this tool, lawn tiles can be clicked to reveal their
type (e.g. a bomb tile). By scrolling with the scroll wheel, pressing the up or down arrow or pressing e, the player
equips the flag tool. Clicking lawn tiles with this tool equipped flags that tile. Hitting one of the mentioned keys
again equips the lawn mower again.

# Gameplay
Don't know the game rules?? Alright, it's very simple:
- Mowing any lawn tile reveals whether the tile has a mine or not. Unmowed tiles hide this information.
- The objective is to mow all tiles that don't have a mine, and to flag all tiles you suspect to contain a mine. If you mow a tile with a mine, then it's game over for you and your beautiful lawn.
- Every mowed tile without a mine shows how many neighboring mine tiles it has. Diagonal tiles count as neighbors as well. If a tile has just grass on it, it has zero neighbors.
- You must deduce which tiles have a mine by reading the amount of neighboring mines on each tile. Flag suspected mine tiles by clicking the tiles with the flag tool.
- Correctly flagging all mine tiles and mowing all other tiles (or losing the game) reveals all tiles. If you lost, you can see exactly where the bombs were located.
